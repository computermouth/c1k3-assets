blender:
	cube to .5**3, apply scale
	select vertex, mesh > snap > cursor to selected, object mode, object > origin > origin to cursor
	textures are geometry -> vector(scale) -> image -> material output (mesh.png)
	when copying a mesh, use duplicate, not copy/paste
	blender -> file -> external data -> automatically pack
	(can't automate export to gltf, as this (https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.ops.export_scene.html) doesn't seem to support choosing to export uvs and shape keys, not sure just don't care really)

models/uv/texture:
	select dude, edit mode, 'a' to select all of model, UV -> smart project
	texture paint -> tool -> single image mode -> new image -> "some texture"
	paint
	make sure to save in image/uv panel -> also pack image
	material -> new -> base color -> image texture -> "some texture"

fill:
	select all in edit mode, alt+f to fill

rig to shape key:
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJzyoEWgCE
	import thing, apply skin
	select mesh, modifiers, dropdown, save as shape
	always save frame 0
	delete armature, scene, and delete basis frame

tpose:
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5hDnOper8o
	import tpose
	scale and place, maybe delete fingers and toes
	duplicate tpose by copying and pasting armature
	in edit mode, line up bones
	select mesh, ctrl-select armature
	right click, parent with automatic weights
	change to pose mode, rotate
