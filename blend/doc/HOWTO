blender:
	cube to .5**3, apply scale
	select vertex, mesh > snap > cursor to selected, object mode, object > origin > origin to cursor
	textures are geometry -> vector(scale) -> image -> material output (mesh.png)
	when copying a mesh, use duplicate, not copy/paste
	blender -> file -> external data -> automatically pack
	(can't automate export to gltf, as this (https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.ops.export_scene.html) doesn't seem to support choosing to export uvs and shape keys, not sure just don't care really)

models/uv/texture:
	select dude, edit mode, 'a' to select all of model, UV -> smart project
	texture paint -> tool -> single image mode -> new image -> "some texture"
	paint
	make sure to save in image/uv panel -> also pack image
	material -> new -> base color -> image texture -> "some texture"

fill:
	select all in edit mode, alt+f to fill
